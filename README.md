Sobriety
========

This application is used to track your current time sober. Add a name of what you are sober from,
set the start date, or use the current time and the app will count the duration of your sobriety.
Counters can be easily reset in the app if you break your streak.

The counter full view will show your current streak as well as your record streak, or take a look at
the list view to see all your counters current durations at the same time.
